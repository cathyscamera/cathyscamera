    <h2><a href="#">Introduction.</a></h2>
    <p> I am passionate about photography, innovation, and travelling. Follow me on my journey here. </p>
    <h2><a href="#">About me.</a></h2>
    <p> My name is Catherine Webster and I am currently a junior at the University of Oregon majoring in Computer and Information Science. My interest in computers began when I was
    a little kid. My dad would let me use his desktop and I would play computer games, use paint tools to draw, and make blogs using HTML. Originally, I intended to be a Mathematics major because it was something that I was always "good at". After taking a computer science course freshman year, I learned the joy of writing code and making websites and programs at the palm of hands. I have always been fascinated with technology and innovation; so, after graudation, I hope to pursue a career as a programmer or developer.</p>
    <p>I took up photography in the seventh grade when my parents bought me a canon point-and-shoot camera for my birthday. What first started as a casual hobby turned into my way of
    expression. Through photography, I am able to capture incredible views and snap memories. For my senior project in high school, I even chose the thesis: "what aesthetic qualities makes a photograph desirable?". Currently I own four cameras: Canon Rebel T3, Konica Autoflex TC (which I bought at a garage sale for five dollars), Nikon F50, and GoPro Hero+. This collection is just the beginning and my poor bank account is crying.</p>
    <p>I have been fortunate to grow up with a family who loves to travel. Through travel, I further explore my passion for photography and my desire to immerse in other cultures. My love of food, also, adds to why I love to travel. So far I have been to eight countries: US, Japan, Australia, Saipan, Mexico, Jamaica, Sweden, and Denmark-- and I am planning to add more every year. There is something incredible about travelling to a new place: eerything looks unfamiliar and scary at first, but you can always find a piece of home in those new places. Right now at the top of my list, I want to travel to my paternal grandmother's home country, Germany, and to New Zealand, a neighbor of my "second home", Australia.</p>
