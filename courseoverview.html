<h1>Course Overview </h1>
<h3>CIS 313: Intermediate Data Structure</h3>
<p>The &nbsp;main theme of the course was "program = algorithms + data structures". We discussed loop invariants, recursion, asymptotic complexity notation and recurrence equations, and linear data types and basic sorting algorithms using data structures. Then, we covered rooted ordered trees and their usage, such as search structures.</p>
<p>The course work was split into two parts: written assignment and programming assignment. Written assignment consisted of answering questions about the topics listed above, such as calculating the big-O complexity of an algorithm, analyze the contents of a binary search tree, and proving an algorithm results in x by using loop invariants. The programming assignment also followed the topics listed above: create your own stacks and queues data structure; binary search tree methods insert, search, delete; self-rotating AVL tree.</p>
<h3>CIS 314: Computer Organization</h3>
<p>The course covers the basics of computing organizatino with emphasis on register-level computer organization, instruction set architecture, and assembly language programming to understand the relationship between hardware and software.</p>
<p>The course work was split into two parts: problem sets and programming assignment. Written assignment consisted of converting binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers; calculating floating-point representations; convert MIPS to C, and vice versa; calculate system perfomance such as CPI, clock rate, and cyles; find hazards in pipelining and create solution by full fowarding, nop, or ALU forwarding; calcuate processor performance when pipelining; analyze caching and cache structures.</p>
<p>The programming assignment was done in C language inc;uding a binary, decimal, and hexadecimal converter and binary search algorithm. I participated in a "special project" given by the course instructor to create a MIPS processor simulation in C. This project had three stages: implement a single cycle processor with main memory unit, convert the processor to a piplined 5-stage processor, and finally build a direct-mapped cache structure between the main memory and 5-statge processor.</p>
<h3>CIS 315: Intermediate Algorithms</h3>
<p>The course covered topics such as algorithm design, worst-case and average-behavior analysis, correctness, and computational complexity. The first half the course focused on graph theories and dynamic programming. Examples include but not limited to BST, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, and matrix chain multiplication. The second half of the course further builded on dynamic programming, with a focus on recurrence relations and greedy algorithms. Examples include solving longest common subsequence using recurrence relations and task scheduling using a greedy algorithm. The course assignments were mostly written assignments that asked us to solve dynamic programming problems, including calculating run time and defining worst-case times. The first programming assignment was to calculate the length of the shortest path from 1 to n, the length of the longest path from 1 to n, and number of distinct paths from 1 to n; n is the number of vertices in the graph. This java program takes in a input file with a graph description in the form I J, indicating there is an edge from I to J. It then will put the vertices in an adjacency list, traverse the list to find paths, then print the results. The second programming assignment was to implement a dynamic programming solution to check if a string with letters and no spaces can form a valid English sentence if a space is inserted between some of the letters. The two solutions were iterative bottom-up and recursive memoized. There is a help function, dict(String x) that will check if x is a valid English word in the dictionary. The main function will print the result if the string is a valid sentence.</p>
<h3>CIS 330: C/C++/Unix </h3>
<p>
    The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with practical software design and programming activities in a C/C++ and Unix environment. In addition to learning many aspects of the C and C++ languages, the course also focused on good programming practices and tools that support them, i.e. revision control and shell scripting. Topics covered included linking, concurrent programming, and algorithms. Projects were helpful in learning how to program in C and C++, which includes using the standard libraries and most importantly learning how to dynamically allocate memory for programs using malloc. The main project for this course was using the Edison Intel Arduino. My group worked on implementing a temperature app using the temperature sensor and LED lights from the Grove Kit. What we ended up with was a GUI that displayed the current temperature read from the sensor. There was a button to refresh and that is how the GUI gets updated. We also used LED lights to indicate the value of the temperature. The LED lights were set up three in a row. If the temperature is low, only one light would blink. The higher the temperature gets, more of the lights will blink.</p>
